## Description
A one-pager to present me, the work I`ve done and links to the different sites and 
Github repositories. The overall style of the Site is neon lights. I added a flicker effect on the buttons
and made sure they flicker independently and irregularly. The cards show an image of each project I made, a short
description, and a link to the live site and the repository.
